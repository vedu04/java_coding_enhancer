/*package jon.vs.collection.map;

Map stores everything in key-value format.

<k,V>
1 key-value pair is 1 entry.
map.put()-> this method accepts k,v as the entry.
map.get()-> this method works same as print() method.but, get() method should be assigned some refrnce, which then can be printed.
keys:-always unique.
values:-can be duplicated.


we only can repeat the values, but do not repeat the keys.
												As when some new value is assigned to old key, it get overides the old value.

Map is an interface.
Map is implemented by-
	HashMap-	Its synchronized.So, its a thred-safe implementation
	HashTable-	Its not synchronized.Its a non-thred-safe implementation.
