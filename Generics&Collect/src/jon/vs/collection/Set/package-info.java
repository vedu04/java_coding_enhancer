/*
package jon.vs.collection.Set;

HashSet- the order in which u traverse/get the element is random.
				or
		 does not maintain any order || fastest in retrieving values
		 
TreeSet- the elements are given in sorted format/ maintains the natural sorting order.
			example- for number- natural numbering order
					 for alphabets - alphabetical order

LinkedHashSet - It maintain the order in which the elements area added.


Advantage of Set over List:
	List can have duplicate elements.
	Set can only have unique collection of elements/ non-duplicate elelments/values.
